# Maze Solver

This is a Java program that generates a random maze and solves it using both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. The maze is represented by a grid of points, where each point can either be a path or a wall. The start and end points are placed randomly, and the maze is solved using the two search algorithms.

## Features
- Random maze generation with walls and paths
- Random start and end points
- Solving the maze using BFS and DFS
- Marks the solved path with '+' characters
- Display the maze before and after solving
